\b threemxl allows multiple ROS nodes to communicate with a single Dynamixel chain using a shared_serial node. It also wraps the direct communication classes in dbl_repos in a nice ROS package. The 3mxl hardware documentation can be found <a href="../../../3mxl/">here</a>

As \b threemxl depends on the GNU readline library, make sure to run <tt>rosdep install threemxl</tt> at least once!

\section codeapi Code API

The main classes, CDynamixelROS and C3mxlROS, just subclass CDynamixel and C3mxl in <a href="../../dbl_repos/html/index.html">dbl_repos</a> and set the package handler to CDxlROSPacketHandler.

<!--
Provide links to specific auto-generated API documentation within your
package that is of particular interest to a reader. Doxygen will
document pretty much every part of your code, so do your best here to
point the reader to the actual API.

If your codebase is fairly large or has different sets of APIs, you
should use the doxygen 'group' tag to keep these APIs together. For
example, the roscpp documentation has 'libros' group.
